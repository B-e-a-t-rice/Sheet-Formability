# Sheet-Formability
I aim to use machine learning to explore the production process of stainless steel tubes used in laparoscopic surgery. The manufacturing process yields steel of unpredictable quality. Thus, in this project, I implemented a convolutional neural network to predict the steel quality before manufacturing using micrographs of the raw material.
