# Sheet-Formability
I aim to use machine learning to explore the production process of stainless steel tubes used in laparoscopic surgery. The manufacturing process yields steel of unpredictable quality. Thus, in this project, I implemented a convolutional neural network to predict the steel quality before manufacturing using micrographs of the raw material. The code for this project will not be posted until the publication of the paper related to this work.
